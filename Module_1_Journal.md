### Reading: Learning Git Chapters 1 and 2
  
The Learning Git chapters mainly went over the basics of git.  I am already familiar with the basic commands and how to manage my local repository.  
  
Last semester I was actively using Github repos for my projects which provided great practice.  Unfortunately, this is the extent of my knowledge, I can navigate my file directories and commit/add/push/pull to a Github repo.  I will say I have been using the command prompt line on my Windows computer instead of git bash. I skimmed the readings and followed along in Git Bash.  I am sure future chapters will be new material and I am excited to learn more Git!
