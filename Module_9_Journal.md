### Reading: Beginning Database Design Solutions - Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7


I am quite familiar with database design. I use SQL daily for work so I understand the design from a high-level point of view.  A class I took earlier in the program also covered database design, the different types, database management and the intricacies of databases.  I did a brief skim of the reading first and took time reading sections that were new or I needed a refresher on.  I did take the quiz did not perform as well as I thought. I suppose that was a quick check for myself. I went back to review the areas of the quiz I got wrong and feel that I understand database design.

I have reviewed the lab for this week and followed along during class. I have not attempted to start yet due to still finishing up week 8 lab.  I have created SQL databases in the past and have created diagrams. I don't think there will be a huge issue there.
