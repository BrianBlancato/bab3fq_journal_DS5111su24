### Reading: Learning Github Actions, Brent Laster - Chapters 2, 3, & 4

This week's readings was all new material for me.  I was unaware that Github had workflow/action capabilities.  These do seem useful to implement in my repositories.  I am still slightly confused and do not have a good grasp of the material.  I think the textbook did a good job but I will most likely read the sections again. As always, I learn best when doing so I am looking forward to lab 5 where workflows are implemented.  I was still working on week 4 lab and awaiting a response from the professor.  I have completed week 4's lab but need to tidy up the code and add comments.  I will be working on Lab 5 shortly which I am sure will allow me to gain a better understanding.
