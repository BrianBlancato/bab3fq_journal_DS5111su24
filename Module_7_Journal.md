# Journal 7

There was no assigned reading this week. I spent most of my time working on the lab that I have been behind on.  I continued to make edits to the tests week and started to work on the GitHub workflow automation.  I am happy with the tests I created, they do a good job of testing the functions and I gained some real experience with pytest.  I have never used tests that failed on purpose or were given parameters. The tests all run as expected.  I started to work on the GitHub automation but noticed that my branches were a bit of a mess.  I could not figure it out and decided to black box.  Since I have not merged branches and have accidently mixed daisy chaining branching and branching off main inappropriately. I have the GitHub automation running but I receive errors. I also do not see the manual workflow button on GitHub.
