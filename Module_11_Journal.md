### Reading: DBT Online Documentation

This week the readings were the introduction of DBT's official documentation. I thought the readings provided a comprehensive overview that was informative. I appreciated how it clearly explained the core concepts and the importance of DBT in transforming data in the modern data stack, which was all new to me.  These are the sort of readings that I feel you cannot replicate in an academic setting. Alot of how we submit assignments and such from our local machines is nowhere what a company is like. Overall, these readings were insightful and significantly expanded my knowledge of DBT.

The second part of the database design lab was also completed. I was able to easily create the tables from the CSV files in Snowflake. Afterwards, I wrote the SQL queries to answer the case questions and everything worked smoothly and as expected. I use SQL every day for work so I had no issues with the queries.
