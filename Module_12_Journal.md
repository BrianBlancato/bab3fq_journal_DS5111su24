# Journal 12

There was no reading assignment for this week. There was a demo of installing and using DBT while connecting to snowflake. I will use this journal to reflect on the class. I thought the class added to my education in data science. I thought it was necessary to learn how to correctly write code, fully test the code and then package this into GitHub utilizing GitHub workflows.  I had a general idea of coding correctly, testing and using GitHub but this felt a few levels above. I definitely learned in this class and found it helpful. I know my GitHub branches became extremely messy but I believe the nature of the PR's not being reviewed early compounded the issues. I now believe I have the full understanding of how to use GitHub branches.  The second part of the class centered around databases and SQL. This was not new to me as I use SQL every day. I did enjoy gaining experience within snowflake as I believe that is a platform I may use in the future.  
Overall, the class was enjoyable and knowledge. I walk away having learned, which is great.
