### Reading: The Linux Command Line Chapters 1 - 5 & Mastering Python For Bioinformatics: Appendix A
### Lab 1: Makefile

This week's readings and Lab were all new to me.  I thought the readings did a good job explaining the simple commands and the Appendix A section was a great resource for the Lab.  Most of the chapters from "The Linux Command Line" were refreshers but also helpful to review.  I also thought that the materials the professor provided and the demo were great for working on the Lab and I had few issues creating my makefile with the correct script.
  
I thought the lab was cool and a great intro into the bash/Linux world.  I never created or edited a gitignore file before so that was also an interesting task.  I will for sure be editing my gitignore files in the future, learning this earlier could have been helpful with some large datasets I did not want on github in the past.

Overall, good first week that had tasks for me to dip my toes into. No real issues or anything too difficult to understand.
