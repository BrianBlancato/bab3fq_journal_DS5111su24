### Reading: Python Testing with Pytest - Chapters 1-6

This week's readings were very informative.  I have made tests for python in the past but it has been a few years. The readings were a good refresher and I learned a lot more about pytest. Pytest seems like an extremely robust library to utilize and just by reading, I can tell the uses are very helpful. With everything, the best way I learn is with hands on activities and trying out what I learned.  I am looking forward to attempting the lab for this week and put pytest to the test. I am also excited to see if my python functions work the way they were intended, I did not run them last week as the instructions did not say.  Looking forward to continuing this project and adding new pieces each week.
