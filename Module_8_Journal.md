# Journal 8
### Reading: Mastering Python Design Patterns - Preface, The Factory Pattern, Singleton & Design Patterns in Ruby - Chapter 3

Module 8 contained content that I did not know beforehand.  Design patterns make complete sense and almost intuitive but I never actively thought or tried to use specific structures. I enjoy learning that different areas of computer science come from other areas. Design patterns first came from architecture and it makes sense to apply those principles to other areas. I felt okay going through the readings but will most likely have to do a refresh to fully understand the material.  The quiz should help cement some key topics from this module.

For the lab, I have started to implement pylint and test the score against my code. Some initial errors in setting up the correct files but nothing too concerning yet.  I do not expect to face any major blockers and should be able to get the lab done next attempt.
